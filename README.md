# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

## Introduction


## Data Structures

### Arrays (Static Arrays)
An **array** is a container of fixed length containing `n` elements which can be indexed from the range `[0, n-1]`. Each **element** within an array is referenced by a number which is its **index**. All memory blocks storing the addresses of the elements are contiguous, or next to each other.

#### Complexity
1. **Access** is `O(1)`. Each element in an array is indexed, so we can quickly access an element using its index.
2. **Search** is `O(n)`. In the worst case, we have to traverse through the entire array to find an element we want at the very end.

### Array Lists (Dynamic Arrays or Lists)


#### Complexity
1. **Access** is `O(1)`. Like the Array, an ArrayList's elements can also be accessed in constant time using its index.
2. **Search** is `O(n)`. Similar to the Array, we need to traverse through the entire ArrayList to prove that an element does not exist.
