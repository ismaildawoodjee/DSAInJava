/**
 * BinarySearchTree data structure using `Node` class from Java to represent
 * nodes. The code `T extends Comparable<T>` means that the element type T
 * must support comparison between other elements of the same type, since a
 * BST is built by comparing if one node is greater/less than another node.
 * Common methods for BST traversal are also implemented including preorder,
 * inorder, postorder, Breadth-First Search (level order) and Depth-First 
 * Search traversal algorithms.
